== Authentication ==
The daemon looks at the file [http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Faq#WheredoesDelugestoreitssettingsconfig <config folder>]/auth for doing authentication.

The format of this file is straightforward, each line contains a username:password:level tuple in plaintext.

There should always be a 'localclient' entry for use by the UIs running locally by your user.

'''Note:'''
If you do not have an auth file in your config folder, first run the daemon to have it created for you.

Deluge 1.2.0 introduces different levels of authentication:

|| Level Name || Level Value ||
|| None || 0 ||
|| Read Only || 1 ||
|| Normal || 5 ||
|| Admin || 10 ||

'''Note:'''
In Deluge 1.3.3 authentication levels don't do anything. In the future they will.
In git master there is a multiuser option that makes use of authentication levels.

'''Example of an auth file:'''
{{{
localclient:a7bef72a890:10
andrew:password:10
user3:anotherpass:5
}}}
'''Example of adding a new user under Linux:'''
{{{
echo "username:password:level" >> ~/.config/deluge/auth
}}}

From the GtkUI, you will have to add the host with a username and password, if you don't do this, you won't be able to connect to the host or tell if it's online.
