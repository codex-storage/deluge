In addition to the steps outlined by GitTips we have put together a wrapper script around git-commit that can be used to commit to multiple branches. Simply save this script as git-commit somewhere on your PATH.

You can use it like so:
{{{
#!sh
$ git-commit -b some_branch -m "some commit message"
}}}

'''git-commit'''
{{{
#!python
#!/usr/bin/python
