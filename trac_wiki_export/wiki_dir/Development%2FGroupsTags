A node to discuss changing the Labels plugin by moving to a concept of torrent groups and tags.

== Groups ==

 * a new level of control for torrents
 * sits between global and per-torrent settings
 * defines bandwidth settings
 * should it also define move completed locations?
 * can a torrent belong to multiple groups?

== Tags ==

 * tags torrents based on pattern matching
  * can match against tracker or filenames
 * a single torrent can have multiple tags
  * this is going to require a bit of thinking
 * by itself tags just allow easier filtering

== Organiser Plugin ==

 * tag-based organiser
  * rules are based on tags
 * allows for moving torrents on completion, possibly renaming / restructuring
 * should it handle linking tags <-> groups or should this be done in the core?
  * organiser could simply link a tag to a group to achieve custom move completed paths
