'''!RemoteNotify''' is a 1.1.x plugin to Notify you when Torrents have completed by sending an Instant Message to a configured Jabber ID. Also, it allows limited Remote Control of the Torrents with easy Jabber message commands.

'''!RemoteNotify''' has core and webui components but no gtk. 

== Features ==

 * Sends an Instant Message upon completion of any Download.
 * The status of all the downloads is updated every 10 seconds in the contact "away/status message bubble".
 * Only Buddies(Authorized JIDs) can send Deluge Commands to Bot.
 * It also has Mail Notifications implemented as a Core Plugin, since the included Deluge Mail Notification works only with the GTK UI on.
 * Status, Adding, Removing of Torrents by sending IM message commands.

== IM Commands ==

 * status - Prints current status information about all downloading torrents
 * add [URL of Torrent] - Gets Torrent File from URL and starts downloading
 * del [Id of Torrent] - Deletes Torrent File with given Id (hash Id - the one shown in the ''status'' command)
 * help - This command

== Requirements ==

== Installation & Configuration ==

=== Compile & Install Plugin ===

 1. Compile code 
{{{
python setup.py bdist_egg
}}}
 2. Copy plugin into deluge plugin directory ( usually ~/.config/deluge/plugins )
{{{
cp dist/RemoteNotify-0.1-py2.5.egg ~/.config/deluge/plugins/
}}}

=== Configure Jabber Account for the Bot ===

 1. Create a Jabber account for your Bot ( http://register.jabber.org )
 2. Log on with your favourite IM Chat Application on both your and the Bot's accounts and manually authorize the Bot and viceversa. ( This isn't done by the plugin! ). Both Accounts should see the other one as online. Only Buddies(Authorized JIDs) can send Deluge Commands to Bot
 
=== Configure Mail Account for the Bot ===

 1. Create or use some existing mail account that offers an smtp service. I used gmail ( http://mail.google.com/mail/signup ).

=== Start & Configure the Plugin ===

 1. Start deluged & deluge webUI
 2. Enable RemoteNotify plugin ( Using WebUI at http://yourdelugedomain/config/plugins <- the ajax theme doesn't have this )
 3. Enter The Account & Password for your Bots jabber and Email account & save. ( http://yourdelugedomain/config/remotenotify )
 4. Enter Notifier Email SMTP server. (For gmail use ''smtp.gmail.com'' )
 5. Restart deluged. ( Sadly, this is necessary because of a weird Twisted Words bug )
 6. Have phun chatting with your Deluge Jabberbot
