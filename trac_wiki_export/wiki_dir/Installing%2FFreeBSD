= Installing Deluge On FreeBSD =

Deluge (1.3.x) is available in [http://www.freshports.org/net-p2p/deluge/ Freshports], with dependencies correctly identified and also stable. 

== Install package with GTK2 client ==

{{{
pkg add deluge
}}}

== Install package for headless setups ==

{{{
pkg add deluge-cli
}}}


== Install from Ports ==

For desktop use (X11):
{{{
cd /usr/ports/net-p2p/deluge && make install clean
}}}

Or using portmaster:
{{{
portmaster net-p2p/deluge
}}}

''Note: The above commands should work correctly to install UI and Daemon components on FreeBSD 7.2 or later, installing the Python/Boost dependencies as required.''

----

For headless setups (no X11):
{{{
cd /usr/ports/net-p2p/deluge && make WITHOUT_X11=yes install clean
}}}
and disable GTK2 in the port configuration options.

''Note:  Option WITHOUT_X11="YES" can also be set globally (for all port builds) in /etc/make.conf. As of (at least) FreeBSD-9.1, WITHOUT_X11 is deprecated and use of OPTIONS_UNSET=X11 in make.conf is advised instead (and should probably be preferred for versions that support it.''
