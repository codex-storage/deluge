= Installing Deluge on Mac OSX =

== Deluge.app ==

A Deluge.app package is available for [http://download.deluge-torrent.org/mac_osx/ download]

----

== !MacPorts ==

These instructions and [https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=deluge portfile] work on OSX Snow Leopard 10.6 & Lion 10.7 with Deluge 1.3.x. They also assume a clean install of OSX (no XQuartz, Darwine, Winebottler, or !MacPorts / Fink installed).

This methodology is time consuming, but less error-prone for the uninitiated. It will take a few hours normally to download and compile along with using several gigabytes of disk-space.


=== Prerequisites ===

Download and install:

 * Xcode from App Store
 * [http://www.macports.org MacPorts] ''(v2.0.3 as of writing)''

=== Installation ===

There are two interface options when installing Deluge, one is to use '''X11''', the other '''Quartz-GTK'''. `X11` is the ''classic'' Linux interface, while `Quartz-GTK` uses the native OSX interface. The `Quartz-GTK` is faster and looks better but is a bit more error prone, so it is up to you.

Open Terminal (under Utilities) and all the following steps will be done from here.

==== X11 Interface ====
{{{
#!sh
sudo port install deluge
}}}

==== Quartz-GTK Interface ====

{{{
#!sh
sudo port install deluge +no_x11 +quartz 
}}}

=== Start Deluge ===

 1. Open Terminal, assuming port is in your path (/opt/local/bin)
 1. Start deluged daemon:
{{{
#!sh
deluged-2.7 &
}}}
 1. Start deluge interface:
{{{
#!sh
deluge-2.7 &
}}}

=== Optional Steps ===

==== GTK Engines ====
To get a better looking interface, you can install gtk-engines2 (or others [http://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=engine GTK engines]) :
{{{
#!sh
sudo port install gtk-engines2
}}}

Then set you preferred engine (clearlooks in this case, which is nice)
{{{
#!sh
echo 'gtk-theme-name = "Clearlooks"' | sudo tee /opt/local/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
}}}

==== Language ====
If you prefer english version (or any other language) you can launch deluge using the following:
{{{
#!sh
export LANG=en_US && deluge-gtk-2.7 &
}}}

Or alternatively, you can use an alias (in your bash profile, zshrc...)
{{{
#!sh
alias deluge='export LANG=en_US && deluge-gtk-2.7 &'
}}}
