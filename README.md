# Deluge Website

## Home

The original site is served from index.php with a custom navigation
header that can be applied to other web services.

## Docs

Homepage and docs are generated by Mkdocs from markdown pages. These
pages have been migrated from the old Trac wiki so odd syntax problems
might remain and need fixed.

### Local dev

```
docker compose up
```

Open browser at http://localhost:8000

Live reloading will refresh the served pages modifying mkdocs.yml and
markdown pages. Changes to any `overrides` files requires restarting
docker server.

### Build site

```
docker compose run mkdocs build
```

The build output will be in `site` directory.

### Override home and header

The `overrides` directory contains the files to set a custom homepage
and custom header for the site.


## Forum

The Deluge forum is provided by phpBB. It uses a MySQL database and is
installed in the following location:

* `/var/www/forum.deluge-torrent.org/htdocs/`

The Deluge navigation header is setup in a custom phpBB style theme
named `deluge_stormyday_3.3` based on the default prosilver theme.

Note: Changes made to live site will not be reflected until a `Purge Cache`
action is performed from admin control panel.


## CGIT

cgit is a web interface to the git repos.

* Installation: `/var/www/git.deluge-torrent.org/`
* cgit config: `/etc/cgitrc`
* Apache config: `/etc/httpd/sites-enabled/git.deluge-torrent.org.conf`

### Custom header

The cgit config links to the following files to provide the Deluge
header nav bar:

* `/var/www/deluge-torrent.org/htdocs/cgit-head-include`
* `/var/www/deluge-torrent.org/htdocs/deluge_header_nav.html`

## Other Root files

### Test port

These two PHP scripts provide the application with a test port option to
verify network connectivity.

* test-port.php
* test_port.php

### Http Downloader

For unit testing purposes there is a `httpdownloader.php` to test
downloading different types of files.
