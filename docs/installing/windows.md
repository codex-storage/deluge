# Using the Installer

Installing Deluge on Windows is easy using our pre-built installer.

Download the latest installer from: [http://download.deluge-torrent.org/windows](http://download.deluge-torrent.org/windows/?C=M;O=D)

On Windows the installer installs a standalone application by default into `Program Files` and the bundle includes Python, GTK and all relevant dependencies. The only external requirement that may be not be installed on your system is the [Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&displaylang=en).
